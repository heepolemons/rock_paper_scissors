# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

This is a project that [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com), a web-development learning website, has assigned me to do.

It is of a very simple game called "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" where two people play by each picking "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" based on what hand-gesture they make, then win or lose based on these picks.
However, the user plays it against the computer, and the website reports the outcome.
